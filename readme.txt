Create files and add script tag in it and connect js file. 

first method is push method. it is used to push or add new element to existing array. it adds element at the end of array.
cannot add at the specific index. if we want so we use splice method. 

second is pop method. it is used to remove an element from array. if we do not give index number it will delete
the element at last index of array. 
it deletes the last element and cannot delete specific index element. 

third is shift method. it is same as pop. but pop removes last element and shift removes first element and then
all other elements are shifted one place behind. 
we can delete specific element by splice or filter method.
